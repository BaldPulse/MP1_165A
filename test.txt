found the game a bit too complicated not what i expected after having played and ,0
i ve bought and played all of the anno games since and spent more hours than i can even count building massive empires with extremely complex trade routes i was thrilled to see another installment released but i absolutely will not pay for something that limits my hardware changes and installs wake up ubi look at all of your other software title reviews both here on amazon and on gaming sites people are not as stupid as you think and will simply find a different game to fill their time with and throw their money at if their freedoms are inhibited by your software by adding drm you ve actually promoted the use of piracy instead of reduced it because those that really do want to play it will find a way ,0
i m sure i would love the game if i could play it i have loved all the hitman games thus far the one star is due to steam steam is absolutely beyond annoying and they do not help you if you ask them i found out after i purchased it that windows xp does not support direct x i do have a high end video card but it doesn t make a difference i recommend that no one purchase any games or other items that require steam perhaps then they will fix all the problems or go out of business my favorite option i am very good with computers built mine so that is not the problem as always it s a steam issue ,0
